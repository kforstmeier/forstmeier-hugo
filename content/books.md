These are a little collection of short works of science fiction dubbed _The Bellefonte Trilogy_. They're in a continual "work-in-progress" state and will be steadily edited and refined going forward so changes both large and small should be expected. All of these changes can be seen in the Git history - feedback and comments are welcome!
