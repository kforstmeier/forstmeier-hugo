- outline:
- future world increasingly automated
- also potentially increasingly remote (likely)
- increased distribution
- ideally/hopefully increased personal ownership
- avoiding tight clustering
- better environmental/health impact
- also decreasing economic barriers
- spreading value wider
- what would this look like in georgism
- individuals living/owning land
- responsible taxation as result
- also receiving compensation via citizens dividend
- coupled increased automation
- leading fewer jobs
