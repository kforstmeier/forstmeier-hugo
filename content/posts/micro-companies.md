- micro companies
- theorizing pattern business
- loose definition
- couple key characteristics focusing employee activity/count
  - 10 or less employees (20?)
    - headcount increase exceptions based on supply chain impact
    - if assessed increase does not consume upper/lower s.c. members then exception granted
    - otherwise hard rule as each company maintains single part of chain
  - majority employees focus core product (e.g. 6 or 11)
  - non-core functions outsourced (e.g. marketing, financing, hr)
- other nice-to-haves
  - local teams or fully distributed
  - partnership-driven w/ upstream/downstream
  - no revenue limit
  - bootstrapped w/ expansion funding
- notes
  - micro companies could facilitate inter-micro company web
  - e.g. providing hr services across many within web
    - or organizing web itself on meta level (e.g. web "founder")
  - still held same characteristic requirements
