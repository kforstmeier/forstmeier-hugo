- laid out by many great thinkers
- focusing distributism
- private sector companion piece to public sector blog
- outlining ways private enterprises could conduct business

- distributed ownership: establish new perspectives and organizational prerogatives that aim to include all members of a group in its direction and ownership.
- collaborative interaction: focusing on creating an environment of cooperation over strict competition both internally and externally for an organization.
- social integration: encouraging private enterprise to build sustainably and to find ways of giving back to their local community.

- individuals owning productive resources
  - exact form depends on industry/company
  - sweat equity likely easiest implement
  - applied across most industries
  - other areas providing actual tool ownership
  - meaning if they leave they keep the tool
  - e.g. software developers with laptops
- companies focusing niche market
  - similar concept outlined future open source economics
  - competing collaboratively
  - spreads systemic risk out substantially
  - entire market/pipeline distributes risk
  - multiple options every stage pipeline
  - "microservices" for corporate operations
  - smaller links w/ greater resiliency
- company ownership

- local market support
  - integrating local operations
