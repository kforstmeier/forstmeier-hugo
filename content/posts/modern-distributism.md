Distributrism is a theory that has long been established and its core concepts have been refined overtime.

In this piece, I am in no way taking credit for the originality of the idea from the many great thinkers of history.

Instead, I am merely overlaying distributism's precepts into our modern world - looking at its characteristics through the modern perspective.

- outline:
- [ ] incredibly valuable economic theory
- [ ] encourage personal/individual ownership
- [ ] focusing building/protecting human dignity
- [ ] alternative standing capitalism/socialism
- [ ] broadly applicable modern environment

Distributism presents a number of key principles that are particularly interesting, and fitting, when deployed in our modern context.

- First is the concept of distributed ownership where non-centralized productive resources are owned by a large number of individuals sharing input on production and decision making.

- Second is collaborative interaction where collaborative engagements within a competitive marketplace encourage niche production and opportunities for craftsmanship.

- Third is societal integration where sustainable enterprises work to build and "give back" to local communities.

These are several of the fundamental precepts of distributism.

---

- individuals owning productive resources
  - exact form depends on industry/company
  - also notable this takes different shape in "information" economies
  - sweat equity likely easiest implement
  - taking account building "ideas"
  - e.g. owning shares of software resources built
  - applied across most industries
  - other areas providing actual tool ownership
  - meaning if they leave they keep the tool
  - e.g. software developers with laptops
- companies focusing niche market
  - similar concept outlined future open source economics
  - competing collaboratively
  - spreads systemic risk out substantially
  - entire market/pipeline distributes risk
  - multiple options every stage pipeline
  - "microservices" for corporate operations
  - smaller links w/ greater resiliency
  - allows "craftsmanship" re-enter market
- company ownership
  - similar point above
  - unify shareholder/stakeholder positions
  - include outside investors tightly in operations
  - members maintain direct ownership
  - also cooperatives where clients own as well
- local market support
  - integrating local operations
  - supporting/working with business
  - increasingly remote/distributed
  - small branches operating with community
  - incorporate sustainable building/construction/production
  - environmental awareness/stewardship
- thought diversity
  - train awareness of biases, not to eliminate
  - provide equality of opportunity
  - avoid arbitrary marks, identify strengths / weaknesses in employees

- distinctly possible executing distributism modern situation
- does not conflict prevailing capitalistic marketplace operations
- provides private entities option integration employees/communities
- creating resilient marketplaces smaller craftworkers
- only risk reduced value capture entity owners
- but aligns more closely with true social justice system
