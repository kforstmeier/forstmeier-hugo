Distributrism has long been established and its core concepts have been refined overtime. In this piece, I am in no way taking credit for the originality of the idea from the many great thinkers of history. Instead, I am merely overlaying distributism's precepts into our modern world - looking at its characteristics through the modern perspective.

Within the spectrum of philosophical alternatives, distributism presents itself as an incredibly valuable economic theory - one in which both the fundamental value and rights of individual humans are focused on as core tenets. It is this focus, an elevation of the individual among the many, that provides such a profound alternative to the more frequently argued socialism and capitalism. Not only this, but the specific outcomes sought by the philosophy naturally meet the modern perspective on work.

Distributism presents a number of key principles that are particularly interesting, and fitting, when deployed in our modern context.

- First is the concept of distributed ownership where non-centralized productive resources are owned by a large number of individuals sharing input on production and decision making.
- Second is mutually-beneficial interaction where collaborative engagements within a competitive marketplace encourage niche production and opportunities for craftsmanship.
- Third is societal integration where sustainable enterprises work to build and "give back" to local communities.

There is much more to the economic philosophy, but these are the several precepts that will be focused on in this piece.

The driving distinction between distributism and its economic alternatives is the goal of placing the ownership of productive resources directly into the hands of as many individuals as practically achievable. This does not mean a centralized ownership, say by the state, where the citizens would then have indirect access through their elected officials.

It is a direct ownership.

How this is executed depends on the exact industry, or even company within an industry, and what the production process looks like. Looking at information technology sector as an example, one of the ways distributism would be implemented would be through a "sweat equity" system. As work is performed by individual contributors to a given project they would receive ownership shares in proportion to the work completed and software written - there are tools that currently exist[1] that would potentially facilitate these transactions. Another example of direct ownership would be the labor holding ownership of the actual tools used in production - in this case the computer on which software was written.

Different industries would require different approaches to apply this model in more granular form with some potentially being more challenging than others - examples would be operations consisting of heavy machinery or factory-like conditions.

These could, again, be handled under a "sweat equity" agreement as an initial cut towards distributism.

Further down the line, however, and alongside broader adoption of the philosophy in the organization, other options such as pivoting the concept of output ownership, where employees retain the rights to what they make and would sell that output to the employer, would also move the needle in the direction of distributism. This differs from current prevailing employment contracts where employees sign over all creative rights and productive ownership to their employers.

Distributism also encourages the approach of smaller producers. While there is nothing inherently wrong with larger producers, and economies of scale that these operations bring often benefit the market, there is potential for a decline of the valuation of the individual in the productive process. Basically, there is a risk that employees could disappear and become "cogs in the machine." Instead, smaller producers, competing collaboratively in an open market, encourages personal ownership both of the company and of the rendered outputs.

This would be an internal change in which private entities would mentally reframe their approach in pivoting their philosophy away from marketshare capture to focusing on employee ownership distribution.

Benefits of this new frame of mind would be increased employee engagement and ownership which would, in most cases, contribute to greater satisfaction. Additionally, this pattern spreads the systemic risk away from a handful of large players into a wide array of small entities with less overall market impact or control. As a result, the entire market and supply chain pipeline distributes the risk - multiple options would exist for any one entity both for its upstream suppliers and downstream consumers. This begins to resemble something of a "microservice architecture" but within the context of economics.

In doing so, this approach allows the reentry of "craftsmanship" into the market - it creates individuals who are proud of the work that they own and that they do. Some difficulties would likely still arise in this situation, particularly around the increased complexity of coordinating inter-company operations as well as avoiding companies conspiring to fix prices.

Realigning company ownership is another important facet of the position.

Most modern, public companies have shareholders and stakeholders but often these two are not the same, particularly with regards to employees of said company. While employees may have eventually receive vested shares, it is typically a small fraction of the overall outstanding equity representing company ownership. Unifying these two positions when it comes to the employees of the company provides a direct and  meaningful influence on the course of the operation overall.

This by no means excludes outside investors from owning shares, which is an important aspect of company formation and growth, although alternatives exist to traditional venture capital.[2]

Members maintaining direct ownership is an important goal and cooperatives, where clients are owners, are also viable options.

Participating in local markets is a mutually beneficial outcome from distributist operations. Integrating with businesses in the immediate, and extended, surrounding area, can generally be economically advantageous to all parties. This may not always be the case, given the requirements of the individual business and the tradeoff benefits provided by nationally or globally available members of the supply chain.

Providing local integration could be seen as more of an idealistic position sought for, and that may not be economically viable, but one worth considering when possible.

Goodwill, while an intangible benefit, is something companies currently track in their financial reporting. And a great deal could be generated by providing local jobs, sourcing local supplies, sustainable construction practices, and generally acting as responsible stewards within their community. Again, this is more of an added benefit that can possibly be sought after by companies but is not a required aspect of the distributist position.

What is interesting about the proposition of distributism in the modern situation is that it is possible to inject the philosophy into the prevailing capitalistic marketplace operations without conflict. No major reorganization of the prevailing doctrine is needed - in fact, a top-down, engineered reorganization it would be counter productive towards expanding the distrbutist presence.

Distributism operates on the acuquiecense of individual decision makers. Individuals much freely choose to pursue these market formations themselves, rather than have them handed down by regulatory edict. It is merely an option provided to private entities as to how to self-organize, but one worth exploring.

Essentially, these private entities would now have another option for how to conduct themselves internally as a company and externally as a business. Creating more cohesive integrations between companies, employees, and local communities is the goal of a modern application of distribution and is, as can be seen in the points laid out above, in now way contrary towards the prevailing social demands around work.

A resilient environment consisting of active, open marketplaces self-regulated by the distributist companies participating within it. While the entity owners would lose potential to capitalize and control all of the value created by their organizations, the value that they would create by aligning their projects with their workers and communities would far outweigh their loss. A move towards distributism is a move towards a true system of social justice.
