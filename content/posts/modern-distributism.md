- distributism theory long established
- concept refined defined overtime
- many great thinkers of history
- no credit whatsoever originality concept
- merely overlaying ideas modern situation

- primarily concerning discussion private sector enterprise
- distributism could be enacted without top-down impetus
- private entities could engage pattern own operations

- several key principles of distributism considering
- see playing into modern scenarios
- distributed ownership:
  - non-centralized productive resource ownership
  - shared input on direction
- collaborative interaction:
  - cooperative engagements alongside competitive marketplaces
  - encouraging niche/craftsmanship opportunities
- social integration
  - sustainable enterprises
  - "giving back" local communities

- individuals owning productive resources
  - exact form depends on industry/company
  - also notable this takes different shape in "information" economies
  - sweat equity likely easiest implement
  - taking account building "ideas"
  - e.g. owning shares of software resources built
  - applied across most industries
  - other areas providing actual tool ownership
  - meaning if they leave they keep the tool
  - e.g. software developers with laptops
- companies focusing niche market
  - similar concept outlined future open source economics
  - competing collaboratively
  - spreads systemic risk out substantially
  - entire market/pipeline distributes risk
  - multiple options every stage pipeline
  - "microservices" for corporate operations
  - smaller links w/ greater resiliency
  - allows "craftsmanship" re-enter market
- company ownership
  - similar point above
  - unify shareholder/stakeholder positions
  - include outside investors tightly in operations
  - members maintain direct ownership
  - also cooperatives where clients own as well
- local market support
  - integrating local operations
  - supporting/working with business
  - increasingly remote/distributed
  - small branches operating with community
  - incorporate sustainable building/construction/production
  - environmental awareness/stewardship
- thought diversity
  - train awareness of biases, not to eliminate
  - provide equality of opportunity
  - avoid arbitrary marks, identify strengths / weaknesses in employees

- distinctly possible executing distributism modern situation
- does not conflict prevailing capitalistic marketplace operations
- provides private entities option integration employees/communities
- creating resilient marketplaces smaller craftworkers
- only risk reduced value capture entity owners
- but aligns more closely with true social justice system
