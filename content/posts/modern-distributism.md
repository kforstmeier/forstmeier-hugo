Distributrism has long been established and its core concepts have been refined overtime.

In this piece, I am in no way taking credit for the originality of the idea from the many great thinkers of history.

Instead, I am merely overlaying distributism's precepts into our modern world - looking at its characteristics through the modern perspective.

Within the spectrum of philosophical alternatives, distributism presents itself as an incredibly valuable economic theory one in which both the fundamental value and rights of individual humans are focused on as core tenets.

It is this focus, an elevation of the individual among the many, that provides such a profound alternative to the more frequently argued socialism and capitalism.

Not only this, but the specific outcomes sought by the philosophy naturally meet the modern perspective on work.

Distributism presents a number of key principles that are particularly interesting, and fitting, when deployed in our modern context.

- First is the concept of distributed ownership where non-centralized productive resources are owned by a large number of individuals sharing input on production and decision making.

- Second is collaborative interaction where collaborative engagements within a competitive marketplace encourage niche production and opportunities for craftsmanship.

- Third is societal integration where sustainable enterprises work to build and "give back" to local communities.

These are several of the fundamental precepts of distributism.

The driving distinction between distributism and its economic alternatives is the goal of placing the ownership of productive resources directly into the hands of as many individuals as practically achievable.

This does not mean a centralized ownership, say by the state, where the citizens would then have indirect access through their elected officials.

It is a direct ownership.

How this is executed depends on the exact industry, or even company within an industry, and what the productive process looks like.

Looking at information technology sector as an example, one of the ways distributism would be implemented would be through a "sweat equity" system.

As work is performed by individual contributors to a given project they would receive ownership shares in proportion to the work completed and software written - there are tools that currently exist[1] that would potentially facilitate these transactions.

Another example of direct ownership would be the labor holding ownership of the actual tools used in production - in this case the computer on which software was written.

Different industries would require different approaches in order to apply this model in more granular form and some could be more challenging than others - essentially operations consisting of heavy machinery or factory-like conditions.

These could still be initially handled via "sweat equity" but options like pivoting the concept of output ownership, where employees retain the rights to what they make and would sell that output to the employer, would also move the needle in the direction of distributism.

Distributism also encourages the approach of smaller producers.

While there is nothing inherently wrong with larger producers, and economies of scale often benefit the market, there is potential for a decline of the valuation of the individual in the productive process.

Instead, smaller producers, competing collaboratively in an open market, encourages personal ownership both of the company and of the rendered outputs.

Additionally, this pattern spreads the systemic risk away from a handful of large players into a wide array of small entities.

As a result, the entire market and supply chain pipeline distributes the risk - multiple options would exist for any one entity both for its upstream suppliers and downstream consumers.

This begins to resemble something of a "microservice architecture" but within the context of economics.

In doing so, this approach allows the reentry of "craftsmanship" into the market - it creates individuals who are proud of the work that they own and that they do.

- company ownership
  - similar point above
  - unify shareholder/stakeholder positions
  - include outside investors tightly in operations
  - members maintain direct ownership
  - also cooperatives where clients own as well
- local market support
  - integrating local operations
  - supporting/working with business
  - increasingly remote/distributed
  - small branches operating with community
  - incorporate sustainable building/construction/production
  - environmental awareness/stewardship
- thought diversity
  - train awareness of biases, not to eliminate
  - provide equality of opportunity
  - avoid arbitrary marks, identify strengths / weaknesses in employees

- distinctly possible executing distributism modern situation
- does not conflict prevailing capitalistic marketplace operations
- provides private entities option integration employees/communities
- creating resilient marketplaces smaller craftworkers
- only risk reduced value capture entity owners
- but aligns more closely with true social justice system
