- outline:
- products focusing two main segments
- consumer/business facing
- consumer often most public attention
- business often most value created
- posit third option
- societal facing products
- addressing fundamental issues
- different from "social problems" defined today
- answering deep questions
- solving roadblocking issues
- preventing societal expansion/evolution
- hindering general technological/social advancement
- products solving these problems most fundamentally paradigm shifting
- greatest modern example u.s. constitution
- generally if not optimally solved balance freedom/law
- created paradigm shift governmental operation
- other problems like this (develop examples)
- speculation many successful companies indirectly address societal problems
- do so focusing consumer/business aspects first
- e.g. expanding personal computer ownership
- spreading intellectual economic participation
- e.g. providing private space access
- opening human extraterrestrial colonization
- maybe identifying societal facing products but unknown
- possibly consumer/business products first
- inadvertently solving societal problem
- speculation whether possible build specifically societal-facing product
- example listed above clearest in mind
- producing government capable balancing options
- other products not so sure (further analysis needed)
